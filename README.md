Neuron AI v1.0 is my first end-to-end AI chatbot featuring a smooth animated UI, dark/light mode, and a smart Node.js + Express backend. Powered by OpenRouter with conversation memory, it delivers fast, human-like replies. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS, it’s an MVP focused on clean design, API handling, and performance.
